			I am a seventeen year old high school senior at Marshall County high school. My main academic interest are in order science, math, and computer science. Some of my hobbies include fountain pens, computers, gaming, and knife collecting.

			 My favorite and most interesting hobby is probably fountain pens. I have become a collector and have fourteen pens all in different price ranges. I have also always had a deep interest in computers and technology that surrounds them. I enjoy many mechanical things with interesting mechanisms or designs. I think all of these hobbies have something to do with my engineering mindset.

			<p class="tab">
				I have wanted to be an engineer for a large portion of my life and have always had a mind that wanted to know how things worked, how to design things, and how to solve problems. I've know since my freshman year that I wanted to be a nuclear engineer. This originally came from a video game I played and got interested, but then did a bunch of research for a paper in my freshmen year science class. Since then, I have found the school that I want to go too and decided I would minor in computer science. A large part of my life has been computers and things that revolve around that. I got my first computer when I was in eigth grade and very quickly learned all the parts in my computer and was able to disassemble and reassemble it even making a short video for a gifted and talented class that can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhsW9boIgp0">here</a>. This video may not be my finest work, but it is important for understanding how interested I was even at a younger age. Since then I have maintain interest in computers and what goes into them. A major part of that is coding.

				In order to prepare myself for this career pathway, I have taken or am taking difficult math and science classes especially those of the AP variety to try and prepare myself more for the college level I will have to indure. In the science the department I have taken courses like AP Chemistry and Physics and am currently independently studying for AP Physics: C. For math I am taking the highest calculus math classes my school offers in order to prepare for rigorous college calculus cources. Lastly, my school offers a wide variety of computer science courses I am taking advantage of. I first learned basic html and javascript through an AP course. I then took another AP course to learn Java. This on top of my engineering mindset is why I joined robotics my junior year.

			<p class="tab">
				I have decided on going to University of Tennessee, Knoxville. There are multiple reason for this and a major one is my inspiration; when I have a sophmore I have Mrs. Devillez for the first time; she went to UT and got a degree in nuclear engineering then went on to do it for multiple years before deciding to be a teacher. So, before even visiting the campus I had a good perspective on it from such a great teacher, but then I visited the campus my junior year and fell in love with it. The campus is right in down town Knoxville in a gorgeous location with a fantastic campus. Then, it was settled this is where I want to spend the next chapter of my life as a Tennessee vol. I applied in September and got my acceptance in early October. I will start in the fall of 2020 and stay on campus.
